# Cognitive Load Butler 🧠✨

Cognitive Load Butler is a lightweight productivity assistant that helps users decide **what to focus on today** by balancing urgency, importance, and mental load.

Instead of overwhelming task lists, the app prioritizes tasks in a way that respects cognitive energy — helping users make calmer, smarter decisions about their day.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Displays a list of tasks with:
  - Importance
  - Mental load
  - Due status
- Generates a **“Today’s Focus”** recommendation
- Demonstrates how cognitive load can be used as a first-class signal in task prioritization

This project is a **proof of concept** exploring how software can support mental clarity, not just productivity.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter (Web)** – frontend UI
- **Serverpod** – backend logic & API
- **Dart** – shared models and logic

---

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK

### Flutter Web
```bash
cd cognitive_load_butler_flutter
flutter run -d chrome
The app will run locally in your browser.

The demo uses pre-seeded data to showcase the prioritization logic.

💡 Motivation
Traditional to-do apps treat all tasks equally.

Cognitive Load Butler explores a different idea:

What if software helped us think more gently about what we can realistically handle today?

📌 Status
This project is a functional prototype built for a hackathon.
Future improvements could include:

User-added tasks

Persistence

Personalization over time
