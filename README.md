# 🧠✨ Cognitive Load Butler

**Cognitive Load Butler** is a lightweight productivity assistant that helps users decide  
**what to focus on today** by balancing urgency, importance, and mental load.

Instead of overwhelming users with long to-do lists, the app prioritizes tasks in a way
that respects cognitive energy — helping people make calmer, smarter decisions.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Displays a list of tasks with:
  - Importance
  - Mental load
  - Due status
- Generates a **“Today’s Focus”** recommendation
- Demonstrates how *cognitive load* can be treated as a first-class signal in task prioritization

This project is a **proof of concept** exploring how software can support *mental clarity*,
not just productivity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Flutter (Web)** — frontend UI
- **Serverpod** — backend logic & API
- **Dart** — shared models and logic

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK

### Flutter Web
```bash
cd cognitive_load_butler_flutter
flutter run -d chrome
The app will run locally in your browser.

ℹ️ The demo uses pre-seeded data to showcase the prioritization logic.

💡 Motivation
Traditional to-do apps treat all tasks equally.

Cognitive Load Butler explores a different idea:
What if software helped us think more gently about what we can realistically handle today?

📌 Status
This project is a functional prototype built for a hackathon.

Possible future improvements
User-added tasks

Persistence

Personalization over time
